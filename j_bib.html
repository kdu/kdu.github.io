  abstract = {The problem of solving approximately in the least squares sense an overdetermined linear system of equations with complex valued coefficients is considered, where the elements of the solution vector are constrained to have the same phase. A direct solution to this problem is given in [Linear Algebra and Its Applications, Vol.\ 433, pp.~1719--1721]. An alternative direct solution that reduces the problem to a generalized eigenvalue problem is derived in this paper. The new solution is related to generalized low-rank matrix approximation and makes possible one to use existing robust and efficient algorithms.},

  abstract = {Two methods for recursive identification of Hammerstein systems are presented. In the first method, recursive least squares algorithm is applied to an overparameterized representation of the Hammerstein model and a rank-1 approximation is used to recover the linear and nonlinear parameters from the estimated overparameterized representation. In the second method, the linear and nonlinear parameters are recursively estimated in an alternate manner. Numerical example with simulated data and experimental data from human muscles show the superiority of second method.},

  abstract = {We consider low-rank approximation of affinely structured matrices with missing elements. The method proposed is based on reformulation of the problem as inner and outer optimization. The inner minimization is a singular linear least-norm problem and admits an analytic solution. The outer problem is a nonlinear least squares problem and is solved by local optimization methods: minimization subject to quadratic equality constraints and unconstrained minimization with regularized cost function. The method is generalized to weighted low-rank approximation with missing values and is illustrated on approximate low-rank matrix completion, system identification, and data-driven simulation problems. An extended version of the paper is a literate program, implementing the method and reproducing the presented results.},

  abstract = {An identification problem with no a priori separation of the variables into inputs and outputs and representation invariant approximation criterion is considered. The model class consists of linear time-invariant systems of bounded complexity and the approximation criterion is the minimum of a weighted 2-norm distance between the given time series and a time series that is consistent with the model. The problem is equivalent to and is solved as a mosaic-Hankel structured low-rank approximation problem. Software implementing the approach is developed and tested on benchmark problems. Additional nonstandard features of the software are specification of exact and missing variables and identification from multiple experiments.},

  abstract = {The problem discussed in this paper is the symmetric best low multilinear rank approximation of third-order symmetric tensors. We propose an algorithm based on Jacobi rotations, for which symmetry is preserved at each iteration. Two numerical examples are provided indicating the need of such algorithms. An important part of the paper consists of proving that our algorithm converges to stationary points of the objective function. This can be considered an advantage of the proposed algorithm over existing symmetry-preserving algorithms in the literature.}
