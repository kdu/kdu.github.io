We consider the problem of finding for a given <em>N</em>-tuple of polynomials the closest <em>N</em>-tuple that has a common divisor of degree at least <em>d</em>. Extended weighted Euclidean semi-norm of coefficients is used as a measure of closeness. Two equivalent formulations of the problem are considered: (i) direct optimization over common divisors and cofactors, and (ii) Sylvester lowrank approximation. We use the duality between least-squares and least-norm problems to show that (i) and (ii) are closely related to mosaic Hankel low-rank approximation. This allows us to apply recent results on complexity and accuracy of computations for mosaic Hankel low-rank approximation. We develop optimization methods based on the variable projection principle. These methods have linear complexity in the degrees of the polynomials if either <em>d</em> is small or <em>d</em> is of the same order as the degrees of the polynomials. We provide a software implementation that is based on a software package for structured low-rank approximation.

We consider the problem of approximating an affinely structured matrix, for example a Hankel matrix, by a low-rank matrix with the same structure. This problem occurs in system identification, signal processing and computer algebra, among others. We impose the low-rank by modeling the approximation as a product of two factors with reduced dimension. The structure of the low-rank model is enforced by introducing a regularization term in the objective function. The proposed local optimization algorithm is able to solve the weighted structured low-rank approximation problem, as well as to deal with the cases of missing or fixed elements. In contrast to approaches based on kernel representations (in linear algebraic sense), the proposed algorithm is designed to address the case of small targeted rank. We compare it to existing approaches on numerical examples of system identification, approximate greatest common divisor problem, and symmetric tensor decomposition and demonstrate its consistently good performance.
