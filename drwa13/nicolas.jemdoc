- *Recent advances in nonnegative matrix factorization*
~~~
  Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a powerful dimensionality reduction technique as it automatically extracts sparse and meaningful features from a set of nonnegative data vectors. NMF has many applications; for example in text mining, graph clustering, and hyperspectral imaging. Unfortunately, NMF is NP-hard in general, and highly ill-posed. However, NMF has been shown recently to be tractable under the separability assumption, which amounts for the columns of the input data matrix to belong to the convex cone generated by a small number of columns. Since then, several algorithms have been proposed to handle this subclass of NMF problems under any small perturbation of the input matrix (these are called near-separable NMF problems). In this talk, we present some recent advances for solving near-separable NMF, including an approach using successive orthogonal projections (joint work with S. Vavasis), and another using linear optimization (joint work with R. Luce).
