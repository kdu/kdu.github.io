  abstract = {An unorthodox programme for teaching systems and control is developed and tested at the School of Electronics and Computer Science of the University of Southampton. Motivation for the employed teaching methods is Moore's method and S. Papert's book “Mindstorms: children, computers, and powerful ideas”. The teaching is shifted from lecture instruction to independent work on computer based projects and physical models. Our experience shows that involvement with projects is more effective in stimulating curiosity in systems and control related concepts and in achieving understanding of these concepts. The programme consists of two parts: 1) analytical and computational exercises, using Matlab/Octave, and 2) laboratory exercises, using programmable Lego mindstorms models. Both activities cut across several disciplines - physics, mathematics, computer programming, as well as the subject of the programme - systems and control theory.},

  abstract = {Many problems of system identification, model reduction and signal processing can be posed and solved as a structured low-rank approximation problem (SLRA). In this paper a reformulation of SLRA as minimization of a multivariate rational function is considered. Using two different parametrizations, we show that the problem reduces to optimization over a compact manifold or to a set of optimization problems over bounded domains of Euclidean space. We make a review of methods of polynomial algebra for global optimization of the rational cost function.},

  abstract = {The question in the title is answered empirically by solving instances of three classical problems: fitting a straight line to data, fitting a real exponent to data, and system identification in the errors-in-variables setting. The results show that the nuclear norm heuristic performs worse than alternative problem dependant methods—ordinary and total least squares, Kung’s method, and subspace identification. In the line fitting and exponential fitting problems, the globally optimal solution is known analytically, so that the suboptimality of the heuristic methods is quantified.},

  abstract = {The paper presents initial results on a subspace method for exact identification of a linear time-invariant system from data with missing values. The identification problem with missing data is equivalent to a Hankel structured low-rank matrix completion problem. The novel idea is to search systematically and use effectively completely specified submatrices of the incomplete Hankel matrix constructed from the given data. Nontrivial kernels of the rank-deficient completely specified submatrices carry information about the to-be-identified system. Combining this information into a full model of the identified system is a greatest common divisor computation problem. The developed subspace method has linear computational complexity in the number of data points and is therefore an attractive alternative to more expensive methods based on the nuclear norm heuristic.},

  abstract = {Linear time-invariant system identification is considered in the behavioral setting. Nonstandard features of the problem are specification of missing and exact variables and identification from multiple time series with different length. The problem is equivalent to mosaic Hankel structured low-rank approximation with element-wise weighted cost function. Zero/infinite weights are assigned to the missing/exact data points. The problem is in general nonconvex. A solution method based on local optimization is outlined and compared with alternative methods on simulation examples. In a stochastic setting, the problem corresponds to errors-in-variables identification. A modification of the generic problem considered is presented that is a deterministic equivalent to the classical ARMAX identification. The modification is also a mosaic Hankel structured low-rank approximation problem.},

The proposed invited session is focused on theoretical and algorithmic aspects of matrix and tensor low-rank approximations, with applications in system theory and multidimensional signal processing.},

  abstract = {Operational modal analysis from impulse response data can alternatively be viewed as an identification of a stable autonomous linear time-invariant system. For example, earthquake response data of civil engineering structures and impulsive excitation of bridges leads to this problem. Identification from a single experiment, however, does not yield a consistent estimator in the output error setting due to the exponential decay of the noise-free signal. Using data from multiple experiments, on the other hand, is not straightforward because of the need to match the initial conditions in the repeated experiments. Consequently, we consider the identification from arbitrary initial conditions and show that consistent estimation is possible in this case. The computational method proposed in the paper is based on analytic elimination of the initial conditions (nuisance parameter) and local optimization over the remaining (model) parameters. It is implemented in a ready to use software package, available from \url{http://slra.github.io/software.html}},
