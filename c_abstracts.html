<blockquote>
Errors-in-variables system identification can be posed and solved as a Hankel structured low-rank approximation problem. In this paper different estimates based on suboptimal low-rank approximations are considered. The estimates are shown to have almost the same efficiency and lead to the same minimum when supplied as an initial approximation to local optimization solver of the structured low-rank approximation problem. In this paper it is shown that increasing Hankel matrix window length improves suboptimal estimates for autonomous systems and does not improve them for systems with inputs.

<blockquote>
An unorthodox programme for teaching systems and control is developed and tested at the School of Electronics and Computer Science of the University of Southampton. Motivation for the employed teaching methods is Moore's method and S. Papert's book “Mindstorms: children, computers, and powerful ideas”. The teaching is shifted from lecture instruction to independent work on computer based projects and physical models. Our experience shows that involvement with projects is more effective in stimulating curiosity in systems and control related concepts and in achieving understanding of these concepts. The programme consists of two parts: 1) analytical and computational exercises, using Matlab/Octave, and 2) laboratory exercises, using programmable Lego mindstorms models. Both activities cut across several disciplines - physics, mathematics, computer programming, as well as the subject of the programme - systems and control theory.

 Structured low-rank approximation as a rational function
  minimization.
 In <em>Proc. of the 16th IFAC Symposium on System Identification</em>,

<blockquote>
Many problems of system identification, model reduction and signal processing can be posed and solved as a structured low-rank approximation problem (SLRA). In this paper a reformulation of SLRA as minimization of a multivariate rational function is considered. Using two different parametrizations, we show that the problem reduces to optimization over a compact manifold or to a set of optimization problems over bounded domains of Euclidean space. We make a review of methods of polynomial algebra for global optimization of the rational cost function.

 How effective is the nuclear norm heuristic in solving data
  approximation problems?
 In <em>Proc. of the 16th IFAC Symposium on System Identification</em>,
  pages 316-321, Brussels, 2012.

<blockquote>
The question in the title is answered empirically by solving instances of three classical problems: fitting a straight line to data, fitting a real exponent to data, and system identification in the errors-in-variables setting. The results show that the nuclear norm heuristic performs worse than alternative problem dependant methods—ordinary and total least squares, Kung’s method, and subspace identification. In the line fitting and exponential fitting problems, the globally optimal solution is known analytically, so that the suboptimality of the heuristic methods is quantified.
