<blockquote>
The paper presents initial results on a subspace method for exact identification of a linear time-invariant system from data with missing values. The identification problem with missing data is equivalent to a Hankel structured low-rank matrix completion problem. The novel idea is to search systematically and use effectively completely specified submatrices of the incomplete Hankel matrix constructed from the given data. Nontrivial kernels of the rank-deficient completely specified submatrices carry information about the to-be-identified system. Combining this information into a full model of the identified system is a greatest common divisor computation problem. The developed subspace method has linear computational complexity in the number of data points and is therefore an attractive alternative to more expensive methods based on the nuclear norm heuristic.

<blockquote>
Discovering the structures of latent variable models whose conditional independence structures are trees is an important yet challenging learning task. Existing approaches for this task often require the unknown number of hidden states as an input. In this paper, we propose a quartet based approach which is <em>agnostic</em> to this number. The key contribution is a novel rank characterization of the tensor associated with the marginal distribution of a quartet. This characterization allows us to design a <em>nuclear norm</em> based test for resolving quartet relations. We then use the quartet test as a subroutine in a divide-and-conquer algorithm for recovering the latent tree structure. We also derive the conditions under which the algorithm is consistent and its error probability decays exponentially with increasing sample size. We demonstrate that the proposed approach compares favorably to alternatives. In a real world stock dataset, it also discovers meaningful groupings of variables, and produces a model that fits the data better.

 Hierarchical tensor decomposition of latent tree graphical models.

<blockquote>
We approach the problem of estimating the parameters of a latent tree graphical model from a hierarchical tensor decomposition point of view. In this new view, the marginal probability table of the observed variables is treated as a tensor, and we show that: (i) the latent variables induce low rank structures in various matricizations of the tensor; (ii) this collection of low rank matricizations induces a hierarchical low rank decomposition of the tensor. We further derive an optimization problem for estimating (alternative) parameters of a latent tree graphical model, allowing us to represent the marginal probability table of the observed variables in a compact and robust way. The optimization problem aims to find the best hierarchical low rank approximation of a tensor in Frobenius norm. For correctly specified latent tree graphical models, we show that a global optimum of the optimization problem can be obtained via a recursive decomposition algorithm. This algorithm recovers previous spectral algorithms for hidden Markov models (Hsu et al., 2009; Foster et al., 2012) and latent tree graphical models (Parikh et al., 2011; Song et al., 2011) as special cases, elucidating the global objective these algorithms are optimizing. For misspecified latent tree graphical models, we derive a novel decomposition based on our framework, and provide approximation guarantee and computational complexity analysis. In both synthetic and real world data, this new estimator significantly improves over the state-of-the-art.

 Improved initial approximation for errors-in-variables system

<blockquote>
Errors-in-variables system identification can be posed and solved as a Hankel structured low-rank approximation problem. In this paper different estimates based on suboptimal low-rank approximations are considered. The estimates are shown to have almost the same efficiency and lead to the same minimum when supplied as an initial approximation to local optimization solver of the structured low-rank approximation problem. In this paper it is shown that increasing Hankel matrix window length improves suboptimal estimates for autonomous systems and does not improve them for systems with inputs.

<blockquote>
An unorthodox programme for teaching systems and control is developed and tested at the School of Electronics and Computer Science of the University of Southampton. Motivation for the employed teaching methods is Moore's method and S. Papert's book “Mindstorms: children, computers, and powerful ideas”. The teaching is shifted from lecture instruction to independent work on computer based projects and physical models. Our experience shows that involvement with projects is more effective in stimulating curiosity in systems and control related concepts and in achieving understanding of these concepts. The programme consists of two parts: 1) analytical and computational exercises, using Matlab/Octave, and 2) laboratory exercises, using programmable Lego mindstorms models. Both activities cut across several disciplines - physics, mathematics, computer programming, as well as the subject of the programme - systems and control theory.

 Structured low-rank approximation as a rational function

<blockquote>
Many problems of system identification, model reduction and signal processing can be posed and solved as a structured low-rank approximation problem (SLRA). In this paper a reformulation of SLRA as minimization of a multivariate rational function is considered. Using two different parametrizations, we show that the problem reduces to optimization over a compact manifold or to a set of optimization problems over bounded domains of Euclidean space. We make a review of methods of polynomial algebra for global optimization of the rational cost function.

 How effective is the nuclear norm heuristic in solving data
  approximation problems?

<blockquote>
The question in the title is answered empirically by solving instances of three classical problems: fitting a straight line to data, fitting a real exponent to data, and system identification in the errors-in-variables setting. The results show that the nuclear norm heuristic performs worse than alternative problem dependant methods—ordinary and total least squares, Kung’s method, and subspace identification. In the line fitting and exponential fitting problems, the globally optimal solution is known analytically, so that the suboptimality of the heuristic methods is quantified.
